# JavaScript Closures

Closures are a powerful feature in JavaScript. Here's an example:

```javascript
function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
  return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
    console.log(`Outer: ${outerVariable}, Inner: ${innerVariable}`);
  };
}

const newFunction = outerFunction("outside");
newFunction("inside");
